The editor **shall** indicate an error problem for every requirement with *identifier* for which the Shalldn analyzer reported multiple text references to requirement definitions.

**Editor.INFO_NOIMPL**  
The editor **shall** indicate an error for every requirement for which there is no any *implementation clause* in the project when the document containing the requirement for which an *implementation clause* does exist.

**Editor.INFO_NOIMPL_DOC**  
The editor **shall** indicate a problem condition of informational severity for a shalldn document that only has requirements for which there is no any *implementation clause* in the project.

$Unsure  
**Editor.CFG_NOIMP**  
The editor **shall** allow switching on and off mode for hiding errors for requirements without implementation.

**Editor.ERR_NO_IMPLMNT_TGT**  
The editor **shall** indicate an error for every *implementation clause* for which the Shalldn analyzer returns an empty list of requirement definitions with the *identifier* from the clause.
